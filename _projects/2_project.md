While smart home devices have allowed people access to more convenience in their homes, those whose apartments have older appliances installed struggle to upgrade and take advantage of these options. A renter for instance cannot pull out the thermostat in their apartment to replace with a smart one.

We address this problem by developing an attachment that can be easily slipped on top of an existing thermostat. The cloud-enabled device can be controlled from your smartphone and essentially pushed the buttons of the thermostat on your instructions. A few features we programmed are:

<ul>
  <li>**Direct Temperature Setting:** Instantaneously set the temperature as you desire</li>
  <li>**Time Based Temperature Setting:** Set the temperature to go to a specific value after a specified time interval. For instance, "Go to 70 degrees 10 minutes from now."</li>
  <li> **Temperature Scheduling:** Change the temperature at regular intervals until you reach a specified value. For instance, "Decrease the temperature by a degree every 5 minutes until you reach 65."</li>
</ul>

Verification of motion-tracking features is a cumbersome task for wearable devices. Typically, to test a step counting app, an individual would wear the device and walk around, counting their steps and comparing the what was recorded. Similarly for an exercise tracking feature, one would wear the wearable and exercise, counting their reps and comparing to what the device recorded.

At Starkey, this is typically done by systems verification engineers whose time can be allocated to different tasks. I worked with cross-functional teams to design and evaluate this automation rig that mimics the motion of hearing aids during various exercises to remove the need for manual testing.

Here's a demo that shows the rig mimicing the motion of the hearing aids while performing crunches.

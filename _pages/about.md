I am a first-year Masters Student at Stanford University advised by [Prof. Fei-Fei Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li) and [Prof. Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/). At Stanford, I closely work with [Dr. Ruohan Gao](https://ai.stanford.edu/~rhgao/) and [Dr. Ruohan Zhang](https://ai.stanford.edu/~zharu/) on multisensory robotics, developing embodied AI applications using vision, audio and touch. Previously, I was a Computer Vision Engineer at [Sentera](http://sentera.com) where I worked on anomaly detection in plants, and an undergraduate research assistant at [Interactive Robotics and Vision Lab](http://irvlab.cs.umn.edu), advised by Prof. Junaed Sattar, where I conducted research in underwater robotics. In a previous life, I also hunted for dark matter in the [Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (SCDMS)](https://supercdms.slac.stanford.edu/) lab advised by [Dr. Priscilla Cushman](https://supercdms.slac.stanford.edu/supercdms-contacts).

Outside of research, I write the bi-weekly newsletter for [Gradient](http://thegradient.pub), a community-led publication focused on reporting the latest in AI. I also spent 2 years on the Board of the [National Association of Engineering Student Councils (NAESC)](http://naesc.org), where I helped develop the DE&I strategy of the national student-run non-profit. I also love kayaking, hiking, films, and standup comedy.

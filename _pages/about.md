I am a Computer Vision Engineer at [Sentera](http://sentera.com), where I work on anomaly detection in agriculture. I am also an incoming Masters student at Stanford University's Computer Science Department. I previously worked at the [Interactive Robotics and Vision Lab](http://irvlab.cs.umn.edu), advised by Prof. Junaed Sattar, where I conducted research in underwater robotics. In a previous life, I also hunted for dark matter in the [Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (SCDMS)](https://supercdms.slac.stanford.edu/) lab advised by [Dr. Priscilla Cushman](https://supercdms.slac.stanford.edu/supercdms-contacts).

Outside of work, I write the bi-weekly newsletter for [Gradient](http://thegradient.pub), a community-led publication focused on reporting the latest in AI. I also spent 2 years on the Board of the [National Association of Engineering Student Councils (NAESC)](http://naesc.org), where I helped develop the DE&I strategy of the national student-run non-profit. I also love kayaking, hiking, films, and standup comedy.
